### Nagios extension for Automatic scanning, Identification and Monitoring of networked devices

This project aims to:

  * Create a persistent storage pool, exposing a unified view of various storage devices (e.g. local storage, external USB drives, etc) usually found in a home or SOHO environment
  * provide a dockerfile for the OwnCloud service that will allow users to create and host their own OwnCloud service

  Putting it all together in a Raspberry Pi 2 running Ubuntu 14.04 will deliver an easy and powerful approach for a scalable and self-hosted file-sharing service.
